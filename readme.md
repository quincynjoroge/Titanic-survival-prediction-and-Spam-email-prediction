# Spam email Prediction and Titanic survival prediction
## Overview
### Spam email prediction
The spam dataset's final column indicates whether the e-mail was considered spam (1) or not (0). The majority of the attributes indicate whether a specific word or character appeared frequently in the e-mail.

Given the data, we are to predict whether an email is spam or not by building a Naive Bayes Model.

Our analysis will be considered successful if we are able to develop a Naive Bayes model that can accurately predict whether or not an email is spam.

We will then decide which of the models will be most suitable for prediction by evaluating the models accuracy.

### Titanic survival prediction
The Titanic, during her maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. The tragedy is considered one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history and led to better safety guidelines for ships.

We shall analyse the data on passengers aboard the Titanic to build a model that can predict whether a passenger survived or not.

We have two data sets. One for training (train.csv) containing survival and death information that we will use to train our model. One for testing (test.csv), without survival and death information, that we will use to test our models.

## Requirements
- Google colab/ Jupyter notebook
- Python and it's libraries
