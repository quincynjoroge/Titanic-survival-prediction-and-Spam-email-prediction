# Spam email Prediction
## Overview
### Spam email prediction
The spam dataset's final column indicates whether the e-mail was considered spam (1) or not (0). The majority of the attributes indicate whether a specific word or character appeared frequently in the e-mail.

Given the data, we are to predict whether an email is spam or not by building a Naive Bayes Model.

Our analysis will be considered successful if we are able to develop a Naive Bayes model that can accurately predict whether or not an email is spam.

We will then decide which of the models will be most suitable for prediction by evaluating the models accuracy.
